*** tl;dr
The source code is provided for reference only. You may not redistribute it or
reuse any part of it, including in other projects of any kind or license.
You can download and build it for personal, non-commercial or academic use.

--- EULA ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Please read this End-User License Agreement ("EULA") carefully before
downloading or using the Jet compiler and/or standard library (regardless of
whether in source or binary form) (henceforth "Application" in its entirety).
By downloading or using the Application, you are agreeing to be bound by the
terms and conditions of this EULA. If you do not agree to the terms, you
may not and should not download or use the Application or any part thereof.

--- License -------------------------------------------------------------------

This EULA is between the Jet development team ("JetPilots", "we", "us")
led by Sushant Pandurangi <sushpa@jetpilots.dev> ("Author"), and you ("User").
JetPilots grants you a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited
license to download, install and use the Application solely for your personal,
non-commercial purposes strictly in accordance with the terms of this EULA.

--- Restrictions --------------------------------------------------------------

You agree not to, and you will not permit or enable others to:

- license, sell, rent, lease or otherwise commercially exploit the Application
- distribute, transmit, host, disclose or otherwise make the Application
  available to any third party except by referring them to the official website
  https://jetpilots.dev ("Homepage") or the official source code repository at
  https://github.com/jetpilots/jet ("Repository")
- copy or use the Application for any other purpose except for a personal,
  academic or non-commercial purpose
- modify, decrypt, decompile or reverse-engineer the Application

The Application is and remains exclusive intellectual property of JetPilots and
the Author. The Application is made available in source code form purely for
academic purposes, and the restrictions above apply equally to the source code.
In particular you may not redistribute the source code or reuse it, in whole or
in part, for other software projects of any scope.

These restrictions do not apply to the code generated by the Jet compiler. Such
generated code will follow the original license of the user's source code it is
generated from. Source code written in the Jet language by users for their own
projects remains their intellectual property, and is not affected by the EULA.

The Jet standard library is part of the Application as described, is governed
by the EULA, and may not be redistributed in source form. This includes parts of
the standard library that are included in source form in the code generated by
the Jet compiler. It further includes standard library code that may itself
have been generated by macro or template instantiations.

The standard library may be redistributed in binary form as part of the user's
program, whether linked statically or otherwise, only as long as it has been
automatically linked by the Jet compiler.

--- User Feedback -------------------------------------------------------------

If users provide us with feedback or suggestions for the Application, including
testimonials, feature requests, issue reports or pull requests, we will use this
feedback for commercial, marketing, or other purposes without compensation or
credits given. We may implement (without guarantee) any feedback or suggestions
we receive, as improvements into the Application.

--- Termination ---------------------------------------------------------------

JetPilots reserves the right to modify, suspend or discontinue the Application,
temporarily or permanently, without notice and without liability to the User.

This EULA shall remain in effect until terminated by you or by us. We may, in
our sole discretion, at any time and for any or no reason, suspend or terminate
this EULA with or without prior notice. The EULA will terminate immediately,
without prior notice from JetPilots, in the event that you fail to comply with
any provision of this EULA. You may also terminate this EULA by deleting the
Application and all copies thereof from all your devices. Upon termination of
this EULA, you shall cease all use of the Application and delete all copies of
it from all your devices.

--- Severability --------------------------------------------------------------

If any provision of this EULA is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such
provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such
provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law. The remaining
provisions will continue in full force and effect.

--- Amendments ----------------------------------------------------------------

JetPilots reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace this
EULA at any time. If a revision is material, we will provide at least thirty
days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material
change will be determined at our sole discretion.
