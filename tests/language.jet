~ Comments start with two hyphens.

~ Values
"the quick brown fox", 'what happens in vegas' # string
`\.?[a-z][a-zA-Z0-9]*` # regular expression w/ compile-time error checking
6.6032e-27, 1, 0, 42 # (real) number
~deadbeef # (hexadecimal) number
3.5+41.2i, 1i # (complex) number
350x200 # size (for 2D use)
yes, no # logical. true/false are read but linted to yes/no.

~ Builtin types
... as Text "abcdefg"
... as Number 233.54e3 42 1.0 ~04ed42fe7fff
... as YesOrNo yes no # 1 bit
... as Complex 1i 3+4i
... as Size 233x52 720x480
... as Regex `[a-zA-Z]+|[0-9]+`
... as DateTime("2007-20-01 10:33:43 +0530") # parsed at compile time

~ anything can be null if explicitly allowed
... as Text
... as YesOrNo # 2 bits
... as Number

~ Variables
~ only one way: with keyword "var". names cannot start with caps.
var x = "5"
var x as Text
var pi as Number
var pi = 3.14159
var magFieldStrength as Complex
var magFieldStrength = 0i

~ Collections
[3, 4, 5] # arrays are homogenous
[3, 4, 5i] # arrays can be promoted, but linter will make it [3i, 4i, 5i]
[1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6; 7, 8, 9] # 2D array literals use ";" to separate dims
{"name" = 35, "size" = 33} # maps are homogenous (in both keys and values)
var mx as Number[] = [3, 4, 5] # write var mx = ... and linter will annotate
var mx as Number[] # implies = []. arrays are never nil nor nilable, only empty
var mp as Number[Text] = {"w" = 4} # again just write var mp = {...} and annotation comes from linter
var mp as Number[Text] # implies = {}. maps are never nil nor nilable.

~ Functions
~ func names cannot start with caps.
~ second and higher arguments must be named at call sites (linter can do it)
function myfunc(parm as Text, parm2 as Number) as Text
    ans = "empty"
end
~ basic function definition

myfunc(parm as Text, parm2 as Number) := "empty" # statement function

var x = myfunc("test", parm2=45) # function call

~# funcs cannot mutate params, except first param if declared with "var"
function pop!(array as Number[]) as Number
    var tmp = array[-1]
    array.count -= 1
    ans = tmp
end

var array = [3, 4, 5, 6]
var last = pop!(array) # callsite must be !-annotated (linter can do it)

~ Types
~ type names start with caps.

type MyType
    var m = 0
    var mj = 42 # just write var mj = 42 and linter will fix
    var name = ""
end
~# default constructor is defined in the type body. CANNOT REDEFINE IT LATER.
~# default construction must always be possible and defined.

~ Objects

var m = MyType() # new instance
var m as MyType # implies new ("dummy") instance, not nil by default
~# this kind of apparently "unintialized" var will be linted to the above line
~# so nil objects of any type cannot be "created" at all.
m.m = 3 # will not crash! m has an instance
m = MyType() # will overwrite dummy instance

~# can define custom constructors, just like a function
function MyType(mi as Number, gi as Number)
    ans = MyType()
    ans.m = mi
    ans.mj = gi
end
var x = MyType(mi=3, gi=5)

~# objects are never nil (but may be nilable).
~# variables cannot be assigned nil, only functions can return nil.
~# nil can be passed to function arguments if it is provably safe
~# (by looking at what the function does with the argument).

~ Expressions
var pi = 22/7 # literals are always reals, so 22/7 -> 3.14159...

~ Physical units
~ can be attached to numeric literals, vars and exprs (real, complex, or int)
var speed = 40|km/hr
var dens = num(input())|kg/m3
var test = speed + dens # compile time error, units inconsistent for "*" op
var test2 = speed * dens # result is |km.kg/hr.m3, whatever that is
var dspeed = 25|m/s
var test3 = speed + dspeed # automatic unit conversion to that of the first
var test4|m/s = speed + dspeed # explicit unit conversion to that of the second
var test5|ft/min = speed + dspeed # explicit unit conversion to something else

~# automatic conversion where possible when passing to funcs etc.
function flux!(rate as Complex[:,:]|kg/s, speed as Number|m/s) as Number|kg.m3/s
end

~ Syntax specials
var a = f(x,
          some=y,
          other=z) # comma can skip over succeeding whitespace and newlines

~ by default use double quotes, unless you want to embed double quotes
var x = "The quick $adj1 $animal1 and the $adj2 $animal2"
var y = 'The quick "$adj1" "fox" and the "$adj2" $animal2'

~ strings can run multiline and will be adjusted for indent
var s = "
    string
    line2
    line3
"

~ regexes can have inline comments and are free-form
var r1 = `^[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*\#$`
var r2 = `
    ^ # match start of line
    [a-zA-Z_] # first character is alpha or underscore
    [a-zA-Z0-9_]* # then any number of alphanumerics or underscores
    \# # finally a hash
    $ # match to end of line
`
check r1 == r2


~ Configuration
/modules # own modules
/programs # programs i.e. entrypoints
/docs # documentation
/tests # unit tests etc.
/packages # external projects as git submodules
